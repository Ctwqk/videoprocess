# Infra Services

This document is the agent-facing reference for the current Constructure
runtime. Use it when changing application services so production keeps one
shared infra layer instead of recreating databases or browser managers inside
each app.

Status date: 2026-07-10.

## Current Topology

| Host | Role | Runtime identity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `10.0.0.150` / `ccttww-lap` | Swarm manager, shared infrastructure, GPU services, YouTubeManager/publisher, dashboard, IBKR, VNC/browser state | Docker Swarm manager node `ccttww-lap` |
| `10.0.0.126` / `CASPERs-Mac-mini.local` | ForWin and news application runtime | Colima/Swarm node `colima-swarmbridged`; host forwards expose app ports |
| `10.0.0.127` / `Wenjies-Mac-mini.local` | VideoProcess, PDS, feature aggregator, and arb application runtime | Colima/Swarm node `colima-127`; host forwards expose app ports |

Constructure as a folder/concept exists only on `10.0.0.150`. The two Mac
hosts should keep project-specific directories such as `ForWin-swarm` and
`VideoProcess-app`; do not create a new Constructure root there for production
apps.

## Source And Deployment Boundaries

Production is deployed by GitHub-tracked repositories, but the runtime copies on
126 and 127 are mostly deployment directories.

| Project | Source-of-truth edit location | Production target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ForWin | `10.0.0.246:/home/kikuhiko/ForWin` on branch `master` | `10.0.0.126:/Users/magi1/ForWin-swarm` |
| VideoProcess | Preferred dev checkout `10.0.0.246:/home/kikuhiko/videoprocess` on branch `main`; auxiliary checkouts `10.0.0.126:/Users/magi1/VideoProcess-app` and `10.0.0.150:/home/taiwei/Constructure-repos/videoprocess` | `10.0.0.127:/Users/wenjieliu/VideoProcess-app` |
| Policy Decision Service | `10.0.0.150:/home/taiwei/Constructure-repos/policy-decision-service` | `10.0.0.127:/Users/wenjieliu/.deploy-build/policy-decision-service` |
| VP Feature Aggregator | VideoProcess repo subdirectory `services/vp-feature-aggregator` | `10.0.0.127:/Users/wenjieliu/.deploy-build/vp-feature-aggregator` |
| Arb | `10.0.0.150:/home/taiwei/Constructure-repos/arb` | `10.0.0.127:/Users/wenjieliu/arb-swarm-src` |
| News | GitHub repo `Ctwqk/news`; deploy mirror currently at `10.0.0.150:/home/taiwei/deploy-github-sync/repos/news` | `10.0.0.126:/Users/magi1/Constructure/news` |
| IBKR | `10.0.0.150:/home/taiwei/Constructure-repos/ibkr` | 150 only |
| Runtime control / dashboard / shared infra | `10.0.0.150:/home/taiwei/Constructure-repos/constructure-runtime*` | 150 only |

The 126/127 directories with `.deploy-sync-project` and
`.deploy-sync-source-commit` are deployment outputs. Do not create long-lived
Codex coding projects there unless the task is explicitly about inspecting a
deployed artifact.

The auxiliary 126 VideoProcess checkout is not a normal build target, runtime,
health endpoint, or automatic failover target. Normal VP images are built on
127 because Swarm uses node-local images, and normal VP services are constrained
to the 127 node label `vp.runtime=true`.

The dedicated YouTube publisher is the exception to normal VP application
placement: it uses the manager-built Python worker image and runs only on 150.
It is neither a 127 runtime service nor a 126 failover target.

## Infra Inventory

All shared stateful infrastructure is centralized on `10.0.0.150`.

| Capability | Production endpoint | Main consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared PostgreSQL | `10.0.0.150:5435` | ForWin, VideoProcess, PDS, arb, news, IBKR, runtime-control |
| Shared Qdrant | HTTP `http://10.0.0.150:6333`, gRPC `10.0.0.150:6334` | news retrieval, arb matching, optional app vector features |
| Arb Redis | `redis://10.0.0.150:6379` | arb orderbooks/state, arb app services |
| VideoProcess Redis | `redis://10.0.0.150:6380` | VP queues, PDS/aggregator/event relay integration |
| MinIO | API `http://10.0.0.150:9000`, console `http://10.0.0.150:9001` | object/artifact storage |
| Redpanda | overlay `redpanda:9092`, host bridge `10.0.0.150:19092` | PDS, VP outbox relay, feature aggregator |
| Embedding gateway | `http://10.0.0.150:8080` | news and arb embedding workloads |
| Dashboard | SSH-tunneled `http://127.0.0.1:7700` on 150 | operator UI |
| IBKR API | `http://127.0.0.1:7701` on 150 | dashboard IBKR tab and IBKR clients |
| VNC manager | API `127.0.0.1:7799`, VNC `127.0.0.1:5999`, IB Gateway `127.0.0.1:4001` on 150 | durable browser desktop, IBKR login |
| YouTubeManager | `http://10.0.0.150:18999` | dedicated VP publisher; deployment checks `/api/auth/status` before publisher mutation |

Applications may contain database code, migrations, compose files, and local
development profiles. That does not mean production should start app-local
Postgres, Redis, MinIO, or Qdrant on 126/127. Production containers connect to
the 150-hosted infra endpoints or to Swarm service names when they are on the
same overlay network.

## Application Entry Points

## Swarm Services

Current production service names:

| Service | Normal replicas | Target role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forwin-app-swarm` | `1/1` | ForWin app on 126 |
| `forwin-mcp-swarm` | `1/1` | ForWin MCP on 126 |
| `news-server-swarm` | `1/1` | News API on 126 |
| `news-collector-swarm` | `0/0` when disabled | News collector on 126 |
| `vp-frontend-swarm` | `1/1` | VP frontend on 127 |
| `vp-api-swarm` | `1/1` | VP API on 127 |
| `vp-channel-agent-runner-swarm` | `1/1` | VP worker on 127 |
| `vp-event-outbox-relay-swarm` | `1/1` | VP event relay on 127 |
| `vp-pds-swarm` | `1/1` | PDS on 127 |
| `vp-feature-aggregator-swarm` | `1/1` | Feature aggregator on 127 |
| `vp-youtube-publisher-swarm` | `1/1` | Dedicated unlisted VP publisher on 150 |
| `arb-resolver-swarm` | scheduled by arb open/close window | Arb matching on 127 |
| `arb-validator-swarm` | scheduled by arb open/close window | Arb validation on 127 |
| `arb-executor-polymarket-swarm` | `1/1` | Wallet/VPN-bound execution; keep on 150 |
| `redpanda` | `1/1` | Kafka/Redpanda bridge |

Do not infer service health only from repository files. Verify with
`docker service ls`, browser checks for UI surfaces, and the `.deploy-sync-*`
markers on target hosts.

## VideoProcess Publication Isolation

`vp-youtube-publisher-swarm` uses the same Python worker image as the managed
FFmpeg worker but has one publisher concurrency and a separate scratch volume.
It attaches to the pipeline network, but reaches shared Postgres, the VP Redis
instance, and MinIO through their `10.0.0.150` host endpoints, then submits
only through YouTubeManager on 150. Public publication is disabled for this
service.

The deploy extension adds `vp.publisher=true` only to `ccttww-lap` and requires
both that label and `node.hostname==ccttww-lap` for the service. Never add the
publisher label to 126: the hostname constraint is intentional defense against
stale labels and 126 is never an eligible publisher node. The publisher has no
OAuth credential environment or mount; keep its authorization boundary inside
YouTubeManager.

## Data Store Rules

- New production relational state should use a dedicated database/role inside
  the 150 shared PostgreSQL instance.
- New production queue/state traffic should reuse the appropriate 150 Redis
  instance only when the workload matches that instance's purpose.
- New object storage should use a dedicated MinIO bucket or prefix, not an
  app-local MinIO container.
- New vector data should use separate Qdrant collections in the 150 shared
  Qdrant instance.
- Do not start Postgres, Redis, MinIO, or Qdrant on 126/127 for production.

## Browser, Desktop, And Market Access

`vnc-manager.service` on 150 owns the virtual desktop:

- Xvfb display `:99`
- x11vnc `127.0.0.1:5999`
- manager API `127.0.0.1:7799`
- managed Chrome/CDP sessions
- IB Gateway `127.0.0.1:4001`

IBKR remains 150-only because it depends on local VNC state, localhost Gateway
ports, and account login. Arb Polymarket execution remains tied to the 150 VPN
namespace/wallet path unless that networking model is redesigned.

## Deployment Sync

The legacy all-project cron entry invoked the unscoped command below. That
entry is disabled and remains disabled:

```bash
/home/taiwei/deploy-github-sync/bin/deploy-github-sync.sh --apply
```

The deploy controller tracks GitHub branches, builds deploy images, rsyncs target directories to
126/127, updates Swarm services, and writes `.deploy-sync-project` plus
`.deploy-sync-source-commit` markers. ForWin changes must be made in the 246
ForWin repo and pushed to `master` before this deploy path can pick them up.

VideoProcess uses a scoped invocation so an application release cannot update
ForWin, arb, or news:

```bash
/home/taiwei/deploy-github-sync/bin/deploy-github-sync.sh \
  --apply --project vp-app --project vp-feature-aggregator
```

The VP schedule is enabled only after a manual scoped apply passes build,
placement, HTTP health, worker, and artifact checks. The all-project deploy
schedule remains disabled.
